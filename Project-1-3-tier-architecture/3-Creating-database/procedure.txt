# Step 1: Create DB Subnet Group
1.1 Go to Management Console and search for Amazon RDS.
1.2 On the left side of the menu, click "Subnet groups" and then
choose "Create DB subnet group".
1.3 In creating the DB subnet group, modify the following:
   -- Name: DBSubnetGroup
   -- Description: subnet group for database
   -- VPC: lab-VPC (choose the VPC created earlier)
   -- Availability Zones: us-west-2a, us-west-2b (choose any of the AZ's you used for your subnets)
   -- Subnets: choose subnet 3 and 4

# Step 2: Create Database
2.1 Go to "Databases" and select "Create database".
2.2 Click "Standard create", choose "MariaDB" for the engine type. 
Choose "Free tier" as the template and give it an identifier.
The master username is "root" for this lab but leaving it on 
default is also optional. Create a password and in this lab, 
"Re:Start!9" is the password. Leave the instance configuration
to default and the storage. "Don't connect to an EC2 compute 
resource" and choose "IPv4" for network type. Choose the VPC 
created earlier and the "dbsubnetgroup", "Don't allow" public 
access and choose an "DatabaseSG" as its Security Group. In the 
Additional configuration, name it as "mydb" in the initial 
database name and disable the backup, encryption, and maintenance.

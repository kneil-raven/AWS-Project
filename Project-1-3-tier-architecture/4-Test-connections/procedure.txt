# Step 1: SSH to Bastion Host
1.1 SSH into the "Bastion Host" after downloading the .pem and 
.ppk files from the lab environment.
1.2 To transfer files securely between computers using SSH 
protocol, open your CLI (Windows Powershell in this case) and 
type the following command:
```
pscp -scp -P 22 -i "D:\Downloads\labsuser.ppk" -l user ec2-user "D:\Downloads\labsuser.pem" ec2-user@54.244.192.36:/home/ec2-user


bastion host public IP: 54.244.192.36
```
1.3 Test in your SSH to see if the file is uploaded using `ls`
command. It should be able to display "labsuser.pem" file.

# Change file permissions
1.4 Change file permissions for the "labsuser.pem" file using
the command `chmod 400 labsuser.pem`.

# SSH to App server
1.5 SSH to "App Server" by typing
```
ssh -i my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@app-private-ip

NOTE:
Replace my-key-pair.pem with the name of your key
Replace app-private-ip with your app server's private IP address
```

# Ping Private IP Address
1.6 Use `ping` and find the private IP address of the "Web 
Server" created to test connection.


```
bastion host public IP: 54.244.192.36
app server private IP: 192.168.1.114
web server private IP: 192.168.1.106

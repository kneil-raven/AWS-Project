Task: 
- Set up a VPC with around 15,000 private IP address
- VPC IPv4 CIDR block to be a 192.x.x.x 
- Allocate at least 50 IP addresses for public subnet
- Must be able to ping google.com

1. Launch VPC Wizard to build the VPC.
2. Click the VPC only to create only the VPC resource and give it a 
name, in this case we will call it LabVPC. Modify the network resources 
later.
3. IPv4 CIDR block should be 192.168.0.0/18. Use /18 because it is 
specified that it should be around 15,000 private IP addressess. /18 has
about 16,382 number of usable hosts, closeset to 15,000.
4. Choose No IPv6 CIRD block and Create VPC.
5. On them menu located on the left side, Choose Subnet and 
create a subnet.
6. VPC should be the LabVPC and has a subnet name Public Subnet. 
Public Subnet's IPv4 CIDR should be 192.168.1.0/26. /26 has 62 IP 
addresses available. Leave all the rest to default settings.
7. On them menu located on the left side, click Route Tables and then 
click Create Route Tables.
8. Name it Public route table and the VPC used should be the LabVPC.
9. On them menu located on the left side, choose Internet gateways and 
create internet gateway. Name it Public IGW.
10. After creating an internet gateway, attach the gateway to the 
Public VPC.
11. Navigate back to the Route table, choose the Public route table and 
click Edit Routes. Add the route with 0.0.0.0/0 as its destination and 
target is the internet gateway (Public IGW).
12. Still in the Route table, choose the Public route table and click 
Edit Subnet Associations. Click the checkbox for the Public Subnet to 
save it as an association for this route table.
13. Check if the Network ACL's inbound rules has rule number 100 and 
allows all traffic from source 0.0.0.0/0.
14. On them menu located on the left side, choose Security groups and 
create security group named Public security group that allows public 
access. The VPC should be the LabVPC. 
15. Configure the inbound rules for the Security group so that it allows 
the connection for SSH, HTTP, HTTPS from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) and 
then create the security group.
16. Go to EC2 instance and provision an instance named test instance. 
Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI; instance type must be t2.micro; the key-pair 
must be the vockey provided in the laboratory. The network settings of 
the instance must have the testVPC as its VPC, Public subnet as its 
subnet, public security group as its Security Group and then launch
instance.
17. Wait for the instance to be provisioned. After that, copy the public 
IPv4 address of the test instance as it will be used for testing if it 
is successfully provisioned.
18. Using PuTTY, create a session with host name or IP address as the 
public IPv4 address of the test instance created. Download the key-pair 
for the laboratory and then insert it in this session. Login as an 
ec2-user and run ping google.com command to test internet connectivity.
It should be able to display the packet connections after running the 
ping command.
